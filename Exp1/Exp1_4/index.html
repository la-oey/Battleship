              1. You will sit at the computer and see displays of letters, words, or pictures.<br>
              2. You will try to perceive and remember these stimuli, and respond by pressing keys or saying things in
              a manner that the computer will describe to you.<br><br>
  		<b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks may be
              slightly boring.<br><br>
  		PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive 1 hour of course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately one hour.<br><br>
