              a manner that the computer will describe to you.<br><br>
  		<b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks may be
              slightly boring.<br><br>
  		PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive 1 hour of course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately one hour.<br><br>

      You will now be randomly assigned to the role of learner or teacher. If you are the learner, you will need to find out where the bullseye is with the help of hints from your partner. If you are the teacher, you will need to provide hints that will help your partner find where the bullseye is and then you will be asked to paint in the spaces that your partner sees.
      <br><br>
      <b>The spaces that your partner knows do not contain the bullseye stays constant across trials, but the bullseye location changes between trials.</b> In addition to scoring being based off of how quickly your team hits the bullseye, you will also experience a delay between trials that will be longer if your team requires more turns to hit the bullseye. There will be 8 trials. Good luck!
