  	Consent to act as a research subject</h1>
  	<p>  Edward Vul, Ph.D. is conducting a research study to find out more about attention, distraction and learning.
              You have been asked to participate because you are an undergraduate here at UCSD. <br><br>
  		<b>PROCEDURES.</b> If you agree to participate in this study, the following will happen to you:<br>
              1. You will sit at the computer and see displays of letters, words, or pictures.<br>
              2. You will try to perceive and remember these stimuli, and respond by pressing keys or saying things in
              a manner that the computer will describe to you.<br><br>
  		<b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks may be
              slightly boring.<br><br>
  		PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive 1 hour of course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately one hour.<br><br>
  		<b>RIGHTS.</b> You may call the UCSD Human Research Protection Program at 858-657- 5100 to ask about your rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
  		<b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may learn more about basic questions pertaining to memory, perception, cognition, and learning. This knowledge may have benefits to society in fields ranging from education to design of airplane cockpits, but these benefits will be indirect.<br><br>
  		<b>EXPLANATION.</b> The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have questions or research related problems, you may reach Edward Vul at 858-534- 4401.<br><br>
  		<b>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.</b> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty.<br><br>
  		<b>CONFIDENTIALITY.</b> Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law. As with all research, there is also the possibility of loss of confidentiality. Information from participants will be identified by a study number. The database which relates the study number to a specific subject will be maintained in the study coordinators office.<br><br>
  		<b>COPY OF CONSENT.</b> You have received a copy of this consent document to keep and a copy of the Experimental Bill of Rights.

 <p class="mtitle">Welcome to the study.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>You and your friend are training for the Olympic Doubles Archery event. The event consists of two players. One player, <b>the learner</b>, shoots the arrow...but doesn't know where the bullseye is located. Despite this, there are some locations that are visible to her and she knows the bullseye might be located there, and there are others that are occluded and she knows the bullseye is absolutely NOT located there. She needs to learn the exact location of the bullseye from her partner. The other player, <b>the teacher</b>, knows where the bullseye is...but does not know what his teammate knows about each of the locations. He needs to guide his partner to shoot at the right location.
        <br><br>
        Importantly, the locations that are visible or occluded remain the same across the match, so the teacher can learn about what the learner knows based on the learner's actions.
        <br><br>
        Your team is scored based on how quickly you manage to hit the bullseye. You will be asked to play either the role of the learner or the teacher. 
        <br><br>
        Next, you will see practice trials in which you will take on the role of the learner, followed by the teacher.</p>

      <p2 id="roleInstruct">Your partner will show you which half of the board does NOT contain the bullseye, indicated by the colored shading. You will then click on the space where you think the bullseye is located from the remaining available spaces. Use the mouse to click on the spaces. You can only click on the white spaces. You and your partner will keep on providing hints and shooting the arrow until you hit the bullseye, at which point you can move to the next section. Try to hit the bullseye in as few turns as possible.</p2>

    <p>
      You are ready to begin competing as an Olympian!
      <br><br>
      You will now be randomly assigned to the role of learner or teacher. If you are the learner, you will need to find out where the bullseye is with the help of hints from your partner. If you are the teacher, you will need to provide hints that will help your partner find where the bullseye is and then you will be asked to paint in the spaces that your partner sees.
      <br><br>
      <b>The spaces that your partner knows do not contain the bullseye stays constant across trials, but the bullseye location changes between trials.</b> In addition to scoring being based off of how quickly your team hits the bullseye, you will also experience a delay between trials that will be longer if your team requires more turns to hit the bullseye. There will be 8 trials. Good luck!
