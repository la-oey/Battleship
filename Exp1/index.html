            Welcome to the study.
        <br><br>
        You and your friend are training for the Olympic Doubles Archery event. The event consists of two players. One player shoots the arrow...but doesn't know where the bullseye is located, though she knows some places where the bullseye is NOT located. The other player knows where the bullseye is...but does not know what his teammate knows. You will be asked to play either the role of the learner or the teacher. <br>
        <br>
        Next, you will see practice trials in which you will take on the role of the learner, followed by the teacher.

    You will now be randomly assigned to the role of learner or teacher. If you are the learner, you will need to find out where the bullseye is with the help of hints from your partner. If you are the teacher, you will need to provide hints that will help your partner find where the bullseye is and then you will be asked to paint in the spaces that your partner sees.
